{VAR_NAME} closed the big {VAR_COLOR_1} book. It slammed shut with a big bang, and a huge cloud of dust came from the old pages. {VAR_NAME} put the book back into the bookcase in the bedroom, next to {VAR_NUMBER_1} copies of the Lord of the Rings, the best book ever written. As {VAR_NAME} went to bed he smiled at the book and said, "I wish that I could fish!"
When he woke up the next afternoon, the magic book had granted his wish, and a {VAR_COLOR_2} fishing rod and a {VAR_COLOR_3} bucket were next to his bed. {VAR_NAME} hugged the old {VAR_COLOR_1} book, and {VAR_NUMBER_2} seagulls flew into the window, to show him where to go fishing.
